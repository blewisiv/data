<h2 align="center">National Hockey League Final Standings Points</h2>
<p>The NHL determines its final standings by points, rather than just by winning 
percent.&nbsp; This follows from the fact that tie games are still allowed, 
unlike any other pro sport:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Prior to 1998-99 season, 2 points for a win, 1 for a tie.</dt>
  <dt>Starting with the 1998-99 season added one point for a loss in overtime.</dt>
</dl>
<p>The entries are all from NHL.com's &quot;History&quot; area,&nbsp;in MSExcel
format.&nbsp; So, use your &quot;Save Target As&quot; command to save them to
your hard disk.</p>
