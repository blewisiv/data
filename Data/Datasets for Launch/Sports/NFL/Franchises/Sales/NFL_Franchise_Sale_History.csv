The four younger sons each had 16% of the team, and so did Dan.  Two will sell their full 16% and the other two will sell part of their holdings.  So it looks like the buyout is for at least another 32% and up to 64%, plus the 16% already held by Dan Rooney; McGinley family owns the remaining 20%.  Sale price set at $840 million a month earlier by bid by Stanley Druckenmiller, so 16% should be $128 million.  Another story says Dan Rooney will hold 20%, Art Rooney II will hold 10%, two other brothers will remain minority holders.  This sounds like the other 32% must have gone to the three new partners.
