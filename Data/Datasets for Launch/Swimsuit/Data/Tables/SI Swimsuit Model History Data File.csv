She began modelling at the age of 19. In 1993 she went to Vanderbilt University to study political science and communication and worked for four months under George W. Bush's father as an intern for the Republican National Convention, supplementing her income with a waitressing job. It was during this time that a friend encouraged her to do some test shots with a photographer. He sent the photos to some New York agencies and soon she signed with Next.
