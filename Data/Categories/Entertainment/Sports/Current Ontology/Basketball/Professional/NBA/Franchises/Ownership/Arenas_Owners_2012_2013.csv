A 3% car rental tax was created to pay for $62 million of the public infrastructure costs and Time Warner contributed $20 million for the remaining infrastructure costs.,http://www.philipsarena.com/,"Michael Gearon and Bruce Levenson of the Atlanta Spirit ownership group emerged as the lead owners of the Atlanta Hawks in December 2010 after purchasing Boston-based Steve BelkinÍs 30% share following a long legal battle and ownership split that began in 2005. The Spirit also owns the operating rights to Philips Arena and previously owned the NHL Atlanta Thrashers before selling the franchise to True North Sports Entertainment on May 31, 2011.
True North Sports Entertainment plans to relocate the Thrashers to Winnipeg, Manitoba. The move could affect the Philips Arena naming rights deal which stipulates Philips Electronics can walk away from the 20-year deal if either the Thrashers or the Hawks leave.
In January 2011, the Atlanta Spirit filed a $200 million malpractice lawsuit against the Atlanta-based King & Spalding law firm. The lawsuit alleges a badly written contract to buy out Belkin caused a delay in the sale of the Thrashers, causing the team to lose more than $130 million since 2005 and the franchise value to drop by more than $50 million.
The Spirit has been actively seeking buyers or investors for the Hawks as well. Minority business group Global Wellington Financial Corp. and Oriana Capital Partners put forth a bid on May 20, 2011 to purchase Atlanta Spirit for $500 million. The bid price includes the Hawks, the Thrashers and, according to a USA Today report, ownership rights to Philips Arena. When the Thrashers officially vacate the Spirit group, the bid then would be adjusted downward. The new ownership group would be called W/C Holdings and hopes to acquire the Hawks and the arena before the 2011-12 NBA season.
According to the USA Today report, the new $500 million proposal includes the ownership of the arena, which is owned by the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority, not Atlanta Spirit. So either the bid has been misreported and the offer includes the operating rights, rather than outright ownership, of the arena, or the report is correct and the pending offer includes the purchase of the arena from the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority.
W/C Holdings intends to keep the Hawks in Atlanta.
The Spirit refinanced the $123 million of debt remaining (the original principal was $130 million) on Philips Arena prior to the start of the 2010-11 season. With the new bond sale, the arena no longer serves as collateral for the Spirit's debt obligations on the arena. This means the team is more portable then it was prior to refinancing and its owners can tap into the NBA's credit facility. Prior to the refinancing, the Hawks were the only NBA team not eligible for the league's credit facility.
In May 2011, Radiant Systems, Inc. announced the launch of Quest Diversus», a new concession point-of-sale (POS) terminal for stadiums and arenas, which debuted at Philips Arena.

The American Airlines Center also hosted several technological advancements during the 2010-11 NBA season. In October 2010, Mirrus announced the expansion of its Mirror Image Digital Network to the American Airlines Center. The 185-unit system features HD brand advertisements. As the consumer engages Mirror Image, the advertisement moves to the top left corner while the remainder of the screen becomes a functional mirror. As the consumer moves away, the advertisement reverts to a full-screen image.
In March 2011, Ticketmaster partnered with the Dallas Mavericks, NHL Dallas Stars, and American Airlines Center to offer fans an on-site, self-serve option for purchasing and picking up tickets for games and the arenaÍs special events. American Airlines Center is the first venue in North Texas to utilize TicketmasterÍs new transactional kiosk. The intuitive, touch-screen kiosk serves dual purposes. First, users may make advance purchases at box office prices 24-hours a day. Secondly, fans who have made an advance purchase through Ticketmaster may utilize the exterior kiosk to pick up tickets prior to or on game/show day, eliminating the need to visit a Will Call window at the box office.
The American Airlines Center is now home to the new Audi Club available to Platinum Level ticket holders. In January, Audi launched its partnership with the Mavericks, Stars and American Airlines Center. The Audi Club features a unique blend of seating, dining, entertainment and meeting space in the south end of the arena.
Officials at the American Airlines Center are evaluating potential maintenance and capital needs for the arenaÍs annual upkeep. Projects include replacement of the ice deck, basketball court, parking lot sweepers and escalators.
Mark Cuban, the majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, found himself embroiled in various legal issues over the course of the past year. In October 2010, a federal Appeals Court reopened an insider-trading case against Cuban, deciding there is enough evidence of potential wrongdoing to warrant the Securities and Exchange CommissionÍs lawsuit to go forward. The SEC charged Cuban in November 2008 with using insider information to avoid a $750,00 loss by selling his 6.3% stake in Mamma.com in June 2004. In an unprecedented response, Cuban offered to pay more attorneys to assist the SEC in its review of the case against him to expedite the process.
In October 2010, an arbitrator ruled for Cuban in one of two suits filed against Cuban by Ross Perot Jr., a minority owner of the Mavericks, which alleged mismanagement of the partnerships that control the American Airlines Center. CubanÍs attorneys filed court papers in February 2011 asking a Dallas judge to confirm the arbitration award which ruled against Perot on all claims and awarded Cuban his attorneyÍs fees.
