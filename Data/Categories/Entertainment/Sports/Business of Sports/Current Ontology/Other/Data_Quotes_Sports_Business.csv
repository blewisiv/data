"1","“Shifts in technology adoption and consumer
behavior have reshaped the digital sports
content ecosystem.  Nobody just watches TV
anymore.  Audiences use different screens in a
fluid manner depending on time of day, location
and other factors.  Many are multitasking on
laptops, smartphones and tablets even while
watching [sports events] on TV at home.”","Paul Verna","Senior Analyst","eMarketer",NA,2011-09-24,"Mobile",NA,NA
"2","“It’s still early days for this, to be certain, and we’re all still experimenting.  But we’re very encouraged thus far.  You combine the concept of checking in through your [mobile] phone with more traditional consumer loyalty programs, and blend that with digital ticketing, which is coming on fast, and you have a Gordian Knot of fan affinity.  And for people under 25, particularly, connectivity and checking in are like air.  So we obviously need to be there.”","Bob Bowman"," CEO","MLB Advanced Media","Sports Business Journal",2011-11-28,"Mobile",NA,NA

"5","""Leagues that had avoided streaming their content are beginning to launch online and mobile subscription offerings and ad-supported streams.  And many are finding that fears of cannibalization of traditional viewing are unfounded.  Content owners that take a proactive approach in reaching audiences on as many devices and platforms as possible are often rewarded with long-term gains in viewership and loyalty.  The top four U.S. professional sports leagues each have hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues from the paid content, advertising, andother revenue streams for their digital properties.”

It wasn’t until last year that three other MLB teams, including the Cardinals, joined them.  This season, 17 of 30 MLB clubs will make the switch with some, if not all, of their seats.

"16","“Some of the results are intriguing.  For example, rating the top North American sports events against the widest audience, the Super Bowl is a clear winner.  However, who would guess that the World Series is second or that the Rose Bowl is third, ahead of the Final Four or MLB All-Star Game.  And the NFL Pro Bowl ranks fifth, ahead of the Stanley Cup, the NBA Finals and the Masters.  Accounting for that discrepancy is that while some of these properties may not score as high an awareness rating, those that are familiar give them high score in avidity, appeal and excitement.  The higher the passion score, the more powerful the property will be in delivering a marketing message.”",NA,NA,NA,"Sports Business Journal",2011-03-28,"Sports Ratings",NA,NA

"21","“As much as cycling is about sport, it is also about advertising.  And the Tour de France, more than any other event, is the time when companies hope to reap the benefit of the millions of dollars they spend each year supplying teams with salaries, uniforms, bikes, hotel rooms and all manner of luxury.  The presence of advertising at the Tour can hardly be overstated.  Each of the main prizes in the race – for the overall winner, the best mountain climber, the best sprinter and so forth – conforms to the colors or logo of its corporate sponsor.  The race is preceded each day over its entire route by a publicity caravan, a mile- long parade of 45 corporate floats.” ",NA,NA,NA,"New York Times",NA,"Cycling",NA,NA

Starting in August, a two-year series of regattas, culminating in the 34th America’s Cup in 2013 at San Francisco, will have a feature intended to demystify the sport for television and Web audiences.
