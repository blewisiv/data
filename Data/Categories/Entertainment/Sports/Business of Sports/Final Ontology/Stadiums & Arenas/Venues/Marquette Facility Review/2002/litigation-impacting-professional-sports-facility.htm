<h1 style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 15px; ">Litigation Impacting the Professional Sports Facility</h1>
<p>by Jeff Tanner, ABA Student Liaison,&nbsp;<br />American Bar Association&#39;s Forum on the Entertainment and Sports Industries<br />(NSLI Research Assistant)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last decade several issues involving major professional sports franchises have come to the legal forefront. These issues, including tax and bond referendum&#39;s, team relocation, and stadium / arena development, have had a significant impact on the team&#39;s their communities, and the area of sports law. The following case summaries presented in chronological order provide an overview of cases dealing with tax referendums, team relocations, and the development of new sports facilities in the United States from 1990 to the present. The impact of these cases continues to be defined as owners seek out new revenue streams and ways to remain competitive in today&#39;s economic environment.</p>
<p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 30, 72); ">Case Summaries</strong></p>
<p><em>Libertarian Party v. State</em>, 199 Wis. 2d 790 (Wis. April 9, 1996).<br />Respondent state sought to build a baseball park under its authority pursuant to a 1995 Stadium Act (Act). Petitioner, a political party, filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of the Act. The Libertarian Party claimed that the Act violated the State Constitution because it provided for income, franchise and property tax exemptions that were beneficial to a professional baseball team. The court rejected this argument because the exemptions in the Act applied to the district and its bonds not to the professional baseball team.</p>
<p>Appellant also argued that the Act constituted an invalid special or private tax law. The court rejected this argument concluding that the Act was clearly designed to serve a public purpose and would provide direct advantages or benefits to the public at large. The court held that the legislature had expressly declared that the formation of local baseball park districts would serve a statewide public purpose by encouraging economic development and tourism, by reducing unemployment and by bringing needed capital into the state for the benefit and welfare of people throughout the state. The court held that the Stadium Act was constitutional and denied appellant&#39;s action for injunctive relief.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Clean v. State</em>, 928 P.2d 1054 (Wash. December 20, 1996).&nbsp;<br />The Supreme Court of Washington granted review of an order dismissing two challenges to an act of the Legislature that provided financing for the construction of a publicly owned major league baseball stadium for the Seattle Mariners. Appellants&#39; Frank Ruano and John Scannell brought one challenge, while the other was brought by a non-profit corporation called CLEAN, Citizens for Leaders with Ethics and Accountability Now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appellants contended that the act funded a private project and constituted a gift or lending of the State&#39;s credit to a private enterprise. Specifically, they asserted that the public development of a baseball stadium for the Seattle Mariners does not serve a public purpose, but rather serves only the interests of the team, a private for-profit business. The court noted that in Washington, public expenditures need only confer a benefit of reasonably general character to a significant part of the public in order to survive a challenge that they do not serve a public purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court determined that construction of a major league baseball stadium in King County conferred a benefit to a significant part of the public in King County, as well as other persons in the region. As such, the Act does not violate State Constitutional provisions prohibiting a gift or loan of the State&#39;s credit in aid of a private business.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Citizens for More Important Things v. King County</em>, 932 P.2d 135 (Wash. January 21, 1997).&nbsp;<br />Appellant taxpayers, Citizens For More Important Things and Chris Van Dyk, asserted that the expenditure of public funds by the County for pre-construction costs of a major league baseball stadium was not for a valid public purpose. Specifically, the collection and disbursement of taxes for the construction of a new stadium (Stadium Act) that may never be built, and which was to be used by a single tenant who had not yet committed to use the stadium, is contrary to the Washington State Constitution.</p>
<p>The court previously upheld the validity of the Stadium Act in its opinion&nbsp;<em>Clean v. State</em>. Here, appellants failed to offer any authority for its position to the contrary. Therefore the court held the expenditure of pre-construction costs by the County, as explicitly authorized by the Stadium Act, to be for a valid public purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Tamar 7600 v. Orange County</em>, 686 So. 2d 790 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. January 24, 1997).<br />Appellant hotel owners challenged a tourist tax imposed by County and Board of Commissioners under a Florida statute. The County and Board assessed a tourist tax on short-term lodging rentals to accrue funds to build a professional baseball stadium and related facilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appellant challenged the legality of the tax, and requested injunctive relief. The trial court granted respondent&#39;s motion to dismiss. The trial court held that appellants failed to state a claim because use of the tax hinged on contingencies which had not yet occurred. Specifically, the stadium would not be constructed without a baseball team to play in it and no agreement had yet been reached with any team. The trial court denied appellant&#39;s motion to amend their complaint for declaratory judgment. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal held that respondent could not assess and accrue tax dollars for the purpose of spending them on a baseball stadium under a specific agreement and simultaneously contend that a taxpayer has no present right to challenge the tax. The trial court&#39;s orders, which dismissed appellant&#39;s action and denied leave to amend the complaint, were reversed and the action was remanded.</p>
<p><em>Poe v. Hillsborough County</em>, 695 So. 2d 672 (Fla. May 22, 1997).<br />Appellants, a county and city sports authority, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court invalidating a proposed bond issue for the construction of a new $318 million professional football stadium for the NFL&#39;s Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Voters of Hillsborough County and City approved a bond ordinance levying a surtax to finance a new stadium primarily for the use of the Buccaneers, although the stadium would host other events. Appellee taxpayer claimed that the bonds were invalid under the State Constitution for failing to serve a public purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trial court found that the new stadium would serve a public purpose but invalidated the bond issue because under the terms of the financing agreement, the Buccaneers would have received $2 million in revenue from events other than professional football games. On appeal, the court reversed and validated the bond issue. The Supreme Court of Florida noted that once a trial court has found that a public purpose exists, the court cannot strike portions of an agreement which, as a whole, the court finds to be substantially beneficial to the public. The court held that the private benefit to the team was incidental to a greater public purpose, and the bond issue thus did not violate the State Constitution.</p>
<p><em>King County v. Taxpayers of King County</em>, 949 P.2d 1260 (Wash. December 23, 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1076 (April 20, 1998).<br />Taxpayers challenged state legislation (Stadium Act) and local ordinances which proposed the financing and construction of a new $336 million baseball stadium for MLB&#39;s Seattle Mariners. Specifically, taxpayers claimed that the lease between the Mariners and the public facilities district was an unconstitutional gift of public monies to a private organization.</p>
<p>The court previously held in&nbsp;<em>Clean v. State</em>&nbsp;that the stadium financing plan does not amount to a gift of state funds nor a lending of the state&#39;s credit. However, the court indicated that should the respondent have entered into an agreement with the Mariners that would have permitted the team to play its games in the stadium for only nominal rent, then the constitutional prohibitions against making a gift of state funds might be implicated. The court held that in order to meet this burden, the taxpayers must have shown the lease amounted to a transfer of property without consideration.</p>
<p>The Act and lease required a commitment from the Mariners to play at least 90 percent of their games at the new stadium equal to the length of the term of the bonds. A contribution of $45 million by the team towards either pre-construction or construction costs and profit sharing with the County for the term of the bonds was also included. The court held that the bonds for financing construction of a baseball stadium in King County were valid. The taxpayers presented no compelling arguments to require a reversal of the trial court&#39;s decision declaring the bonds were not an unconstitutional gift of public monies to a private organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>St. Louis Convention &amp; Visitors Comm&#39;n v. NFL</em>, 154 F.3d 851 (Fed. Cir. September 3, 1998).<br />Appellant Convention and Visitors Center (CVC) founded a civic organization called FANS, Inc., to pursue a National Football League team for the City. FANS entered into an agreement with the Los Angeles Rams to move to St. Louis. NFL league rules required a favorable vote of team owners to permit relocation, and the initial proposal for the Rams was voted down. It was later approved after the Rams agreed to pay a $29 million relocation fee to the league. CVC agreed to pay $20 million of this fee. During the team&#39;s inaugural year in St. Louis, the CVC was unable to make some of the payments owed to the team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CVC then brought this suit against the league, claiming that the NFL relocation rules violated the Sherman Act and that imposition of the high relocation fee tortiously interfered with CVC&#39;c contract with the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court held that CVC failed to present evidence that the relocation fee caused a breach in its lease agreement with the Rams. Under State law a breach is a necessary element of a tortious interference claim. CVC simply modified its agreement with the Rams to accommodate the size of the fee.</p>
<p>The court also concluded that CVC failed to show that the NFL&#39;s rules had actually caused teams other than the Rams to refrain from competitive bidding on the stadium lease, thus no anti-competitive action existed to support the Sherman Act claim.</p>
<p>The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, which granted respondent&#39;s motion for judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Brower v. State</em>, 969 P.2d 42 (Wash. December 24, 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1088 (April 26, 1999).&nbsp;<br />Appellant Jordan Brower, a taxpayer, raised constitutional challenges to state legislation in connection with provisions that conditioned the referral of a referendum to the people on the payment of costs of the election by respondent, a team affiliate. The referendum was to build a new stadium for the NFL&#39;s Seattle Seahawks. Respondent Football Northwest, Inc. had an option to purchase the team from its current ownership but conditioned its purchase on the enactment of the legislation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appellant&#39;s complaint focused specifically on the legislative provision that the Act would be null and void unless respondent entered into an agreement with the Secretary of State to reimburse the state for the costs of the special election. Appellant contended that this illegally placed the power of referendum in the hands of a private party, because no referendum would occur unless Football Northwest agreed to reimburse the costs of the election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court stated that conditioning the effect of a statute upon a future event specified by the Legislature does not transfer the state legislative power to render judgment to the persons or entity capable if bringing about that event. Here, the Legislature determined it was necessary to condition the Act on a requirement that the costs of the election be paid by Football Northwest in order to avoid the expenditure of public funds in connection with a public stadium project unless the voters approved the Act. Because this judgment was made by the Legislature, no unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority occurred. The court concluded that the legislation was valid and affirmed summary judgment in favor of respondents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A<em>llegheny Inst. Taxpayers Coalition v. Allegheny Reg&#39;l Asset Dist</em>., 727 A.2d 113 (Pa. March 24, 1999), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 998 (April 23, 2001).&nbsp;<br />The Court combined appeals from two prior decisions dismissing challenges to the &quot;Plan B&quot; funding plan, which would provide long-term public financing for a stadium for MLB&#39;s Pittsburgh Pirates, the NFL&#39;s Pittsburgh Steelers, and improvements to a convention center located in the City of Pittsburgh. The first case was brought by the Allegheny Institute Taxpayers Coalition against the Allegheny Regional Asset District (RAD) and members of the regional asset district board. The second was brought against RAD by a class of local residents. Both claimants claimed RAD&#39;s action adopting the funding plan was illegal under the RAD enabling statute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue on appeal was whether RAD, in adopting the resolution that would finance a bond issue by dedicating $402,000,000 in future sales tax revenues in order to fund two stadiums for professional sports franchises, was within its scope of authority as a local government unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Court, having found no statutory violation or other error, stated that it would not substitute its judgment for that of a properly formed local government unit and affirmed the trial court&#39;s dismissal of the complaints.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Giordano v. Ridge</em>, 737 A.2d 350 (Pa. Commw. Ct. August 31, 1999), appeal, 739 A.2d 1052 (Pa. October 5, 1999), aff&#39;d 753 A.2d 1277 (Pa. June 20, 2000), reconsideration denied, 2000 Pa. LEXIS 2247 (Pa. August 10, 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 928 (October 10, 2000).<br />Petitioner taxpayer brought an action challenging the constitutionality of the Capital Facilities Debt Enabling Act. The Act authorized and provided procedures for municipalities to apply to the Commonwealth for state funding of certain capital projects, including sports facilities. Plaintiff&#39;s petition for review requested that the Court issue a declaratory judgment finding that the Act violated the State Constitution by incurring debt on behalf of the state and/or pledging credit to an individual, company, corporation, or association.</p>
<p>Tom Ridge, Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; Mike Fisher, Attorney General; the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and the Cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh (collectively &quot;respondents&quot;) filed a demurrer alleging that the taxpayer&#39;s claim was insufficient and failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Specifically, they argued that under the Act the money flows from the Commonwealth to a municipality or municipal authority and not directly to the private entity and thus was not improper.</p>
<p>The court agreed noting that even assuming the credit of the Commonwealth was being pledged or loaned within the meaning of the State Constitution, it would be to a municipality or authority and not an individual or private association. Therefore, the respondents demurrer was sustained and the plaintiff&#39;s claims were dismissed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Leonard v. Cornyn</em>, 47 S.W.3d 524 (Tex. App. October 7, 1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1081 (January 8, 2001).<br />Appellant taxpayer, Erik Leonard, appealed trial court judgment dismissing his complaint against John Cornyn, in his official capacity as Attorney General of Texas, for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. Plaintiff sought declaratory relief requesting that the municipal and county bonds for a new baseball stadium for MLB&#39;s Texas Rangers, issued by appellees city, county, and board be declared invalid.</p>
<p>The voters of Harris County and City of Houston approved resolutions authorizing a board that could issue bonds necessary to build a new professional sports stadium. The bonds were supported by a Texas statute precluding judicial inquiry into their validity following approval by Cornyn and subsequently issued. The Court of Appeals held that the effect of the statute was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</p>
<p><em>Citizens of Springfield et al. v. Dreison Invs., Inc.</em>, 2000 Mass. Super LEXIS 131 (MASS. Super. Ct. February 25, 2000).&nbsp;<br />The issue before the court arose from the City of Springfield&#39;s use of its eminent domain power to take three privately owned parcels for &quot;municipal purposes.&quot; The purpose was to lease the property to the Springfield Baseball Corporation in order to build a minor league baseball stadium. United States Constitutional principals require that governmental condemnation of land must be for a public purpose and just compensation must be paid to the owner of the land.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Massachusetts&#39; law requires a balancing of public use versus private interest in determining a valid public purpose. The Supreme Judicial Court has held that public-private partnerships designed to promote economic revitalization of blighted areas meet public purpose requirements when the legislation that gave rise to the partnership provided appropriate controls and oversight to protect the public interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case at bar, the City was to expend both general revenue and state grant money to acquire the stadium parcels. The City was not to receive rent from the lessee nor any portion of fees paid to Springfield Baseball Corporation by third-party users of the facility. Based on these provisions the court held that the land takings were not a valid exercise of the general eminent domain powers of the City and were not made primarily for a public purpose.</p>
<p><em>Ragsdale v. City of Memphis</em>, 70 S.W. 3d 56 (Tenn. Ct. App. August 17, 2001).<br />Appellee taxpayers sued City seeking a declaratory judgment that acts to facilitate the building of a sports arena were unconstitutional. The trial court found the financing arrangement to construct a new arena for a professional basketball team to be unconstitutional and the City sought review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The City and County created a sports authority, in compliance with a State Sports Authorities Act of 1993 (Tennessee). A proposal was made that the Sports Authority issue bonds for the construction of a multi-use arena by a private third party company (Hoops, L.P.), in an effort to attract a National Basketball Association franchise. The City and the County agreed to contribute revenues toward this effort. Appellant taxpayers complained that this activity violated the State Constitution, which greatly limited the ability of a county, city, or town to lend its credit to a private entity.</p>
<p>The court held that because the City and County were contributing existing revenue, they were not pledging their credit. The actions of the city and county were permissible under the &quot;public purpose&quot; exception to the State Constitution. The court further noted that it was not appropriate for a court to substitute its judgment on an issue for that of a governmental body. The fact that the private company would derive some benefit did not invalidate the public purpose. The trial court&#39;s judgment that the taxpayers had standing was affirmed. Otherwise, the trial court&#39;s judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded.</p>
<p><em>Roper v. City of Clearwater</em>, 796 So. 2d 1159 (Fla. August 23, 2001).<br />Appellant taxpayer appealed from the circuit court&#39;s order, which validated respondent City&#39;s proposed revenue bonds. The bonds were to be used in funding the development of a new major league baseball spring training facility for MLB&#39;s Philadelphia Phillies. Respondent City&#39;s Charter required a referendum for bonds issued in excess of $1 million, unless certain exceptions applied. One such exception applied to revenue bonds issued for projects for &quot;industrial development.&quot;</p>
<p>Referencing existing definitions within a State Statute, respondent City determined that the spring training project was a project for &quot;industrial development.&quot; Pursuant to the Municipal Home Rule Powers Act, which provided that municipalities have full authority to issue bonds, respondent attempted to validate the development bonds. Appellant argued that having relied on the definition provided, respondent must also comply with all other provisions within the Statute, which included a mandatory referendum.</p>
<p>The court held that the State Statute was supplemental to, and did not invalidate other sources of authority, which in this case was the Municipal Home Rule Powers Act. The City did not invoke, nor did it intend to invoke, the State Statute in attempting to issue the development bonds. The City was not bound by the referendum requirement and the judgment validating the bonds was upheld.</p>
<p><em>State Ex. Rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Krings</em>, 758 N.E. 2d 1135 (Ohio December 19, 2001).<br />Appellee newspaper filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus to compel appellants, a county administrator and two construction companies, to provide it with access to records dealing with the construction of a football stadium for the NFL&#39;s Cincinnati Bengals. The Court of Appeals granted the writ, ordered appellants to provide the newspaper with the records, and awarded attorney fees against the administrator. Appellants sought review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On appeal, appellants argued that the court erred in granting the writ to compel access to the records. The court held that by exercising its statutory authority to construct the stadium for specified public purposes, the board of county commissioners invoked the attendant duty to provide public access, via proper records requests, to records relating to that construction. The requested records should have been made available for the newspaper&#39;s inspection after the initial request to the administrator so that it did not have to deal with a private third party in order to gain access to the records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court of appeals properly held that the requested cost-overrun records were within the jurisdiction of the board, which appointed the administrator, and that the records were &quot;public records.&quot; The judgment was affirmed.</p>
<p><em>Metro. Sports Facilities Comm&#39;n v. Minn. Twins P&#39;ship</em>, 638 N.W.2d 214 (Minn. Ct. App. January 22, 2002), review denied by, 2002 Minn. LEXIS 73 (Minn. February 4, 2002).<br />Respondent commission brought a declaratory judgment action seeking specific performance of the use agreement between the Commission and Minnesota Twins; and an injunction preventing Major League Baseball from interfering with the Commission&#39;s contractual relationship with the team. The District Court (Minnesota) granted the Commission a temporary injunction. The appellants sought judicial review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission was concerned that the team would not comply with their one-year use agreement amid reports that the league intended to eliminate or &quot;contract&quot; two franchises, including the Twins. On appeal, the Twins claimed that the district court abused its discretion in temporarily enjoining the team from breaching the use agreement and enjoining the league from interfering with the Commission&#39;s contractual relationship with the team. The appellate court held that issuing the temporary injunction in order to maintain the status quo pending resolution of the merits of the case was not an abuse of discretion and affirmed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court held that the temporary injunction did not create a new legal relationship; it maintained the parties&#39; existing relationship. The agreement authorized the use of remedies available at law or in equity, including injunctive relief, and it was unlikely that money damages could fully compensate the Commission for the team&#39;s breach. The judgment was affirmed.&nbsp;</p>
