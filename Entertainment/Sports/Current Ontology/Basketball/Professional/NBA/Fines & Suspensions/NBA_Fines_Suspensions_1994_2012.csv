The league will likely hand down heavy fines for Minnesota.

The NBA is still determining possible suspensions for team personnel for their involvement in the illegal agreement. Voiding Smith's past contracts removed his Larry Bird rights with the team [ability to re-sign regardless of Minnesota's salary cap after he has played with the team for 3 seasons] and Minnesota's opportunity to re-sign him at 120% of last season's salary (Minnesota has already used their $2.25 million exception) [voiding the past contracts does not involve Smith having to give back any money].

Ron Artest (Ind) was suspended for the rest of the season (72 games). Stephen Jackson (Ind) was suspended for 30 games. Jermaine O'Neal (Ind) was suspended for 25 games.

All 3 threw punches at fans and Artest and Jackson went into the stands. Anthony Johnson (Ind) was suspended 6 games - he was the player in street clothes who punched a fan on the court right after Artest and the fan had a confrontation. His suspension will not start until he is physically able to play. Ben Wallace (Det) was suspended for 6 games for his two handed shove to Artest's face during the game and for throwing a towel at Artest after the players had been separated. Elden Campbell (Det), Chauncey Billups (Det), Derrick Coleman (Det), and Reggie Miller (Ind) were suspended for 1 game for leaving the bench during the on court altercation between Wallace and Artest. Artest, Jackson, and O'Neal will be listed on a suspended list so Indiana will be able to sign players for their spots while the players are suspended (and, thus, exceed the 15 player roster maximum). Commissioner David Stern: ""The penalties issued today deal only with one aspect of this incident that of player misconduct. The actions of the players involved wildly exceeded the professionalism and self-control that should fairly be expected from NBA players. We must affirm that the NBA will strive to exemplify the best that can be offered by professional sports, and not allow our sport to be debased by what seem to be declining expectations for behavior of fans and athletes alike."" Stern: ""To watch the out-of-control fans in the stands was disgusting. It doesn't excuse our players from going into the stands."""
